                            I worked on this project in CS397: Rapid Software Prototyping. 
                            It is a web app called Truss made with React.

                        <br>
                        <div>
                            To use this app, you first must sign in with Google using the sign in button
                            at the top right of the screen.
                            After you sign in, you can either create a project or join an existing one with a code.
                            Once you create a project, you will be given a code that you can share with others
                            so that they can join your project.
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <div>
                            Inside each project, you can create tasks. The chat button on the corner of each task
                            opens a window where you and your groupmates can discuss the issue. You can also move
                            tasks to the "Backlog," "ToDo," and "Done" categories accordingly. In addition, there is
                            an Archive button for tasks that you no longer want to complete.
