                    <div>
                        I worked on this project in CS397: Rapid Software Prototyping. 
                        It is a web app called ClockIn made with React.
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <div>
                        Never turn off your alarm and fall back asleep with ClockIn!
                        ClockIn makes you solve a puzzle in order to turn your alarm off.
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <div>
                        To you the web app, first you must sign in to see your list of alarms.
                        You can set a new alarm or check/uncheck any of your current ones. 
                        At the top of the screen, there is a switch that determines the type of puzzle
                        you will need to solve. The options are word puzzles where you need to unscramble
                        a random word and math problems where you need to solve a simple random equation.
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <div>
                        When the set time occurs, the alarm will start ringing and will not stop until you
                        correctly solve the puzzle.
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <div>
                        If you no longer want the alarm in your list, you can delete it.
                    </div>
